Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Using cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar, the system can control steering, acceleration, and braking under certain conditions, enhancing driver safety and convenience.\n\nTesla's commitment to sustainability is evident in the Model S's vegan interior option, which uses synthetic materials instead of leather. This option caters to environmentally conscious consumers seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and animal product consumption.\n\nThe Model S has a unique glass roof that provides passengers with a panoramic view of the sky, enhancing the driving experience with an open, airy feel. This feature also includes UV and infrared protection to keep the cabin comfortable in various weather conditions.\n\nTesla's supercharger network allows Model S owners to charge their vehicles quickly while on long trips, providing up to 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes of charging. This extensive network ensures convenience and minimal downtime for Tesla drivers.\n\nThe Model S's performance version, the Plaid, can reach top speeds of up to 200 mph,\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION, COMPANY<|>Tesla is an automotive company known for its electric vehicles and commitment to sustainability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODEL S<|>PRODUCT, VEHICLE<|>The Model S is a luxury electric sedan produced by Tesla, featuring advanced technology and sustainability options)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPILOT SYSTEM<|>TECHNOLOGY, SYSTEM<|>The Autopilot system is a semi-autonomous driving technology developed by Tesla, using cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to control steering, acceleration, and braking under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGAN INTERIOR OPTION<|>FEATURE, OPTION<|>The vegan interior option in the Model S uses synthetic materials instead of leather, catering to environmentally conscious consumers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLASS ROOF<|>FEATURE, COMPONENT<|>The glass roof in the Model S provides a panoramic view of the sky and includes UV and infrared protection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERCHARGER NETWORK<|>INFRASTRUCTURE, NETWORK<|>Tesla's supercharger network allows Model S owners to charge their vehicles quickly, providing up to 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLAID<|>PRODUCT, VEHICLE<|>The Plaid is the performance version of the Model S, capable of reaching top speeds of up to 200 mph)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>MODEL S<|>Tesla manufactures the Model S, a luxury electric sedan<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>AUTOPILOT SYSTEM<|>The Model S is equipped with Tesla's Autopilot system for semi-autonomous driving<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>VEGAN INTERIOR OPTION<|>The Model S offers a vegan interior option using synthetic materials<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>GLASS ROOF<|>The Model S features a unique glass roof with UV and infrared protection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>SUPERCHARGER NETWORK<|>Model S owners can use Tesla's supercharger network for quick charging<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>PLAID<|>The Plaid is the high-performance version of the Model S<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: drag coefficient of just 0.208, the Tesla Model S stands out as one of the most aerodynamically efficient cars in production today. Its sleek design not only contributes to its aesthetics but also improves its range and speed by reducing air resistance. \n\nOne of the pioneering features of the Model S is its ability to receive over-the-air software updates. This capability allows Tesla to remotely improve the car's performance, introduce new features, and fix bugs, ensuring that the vehicle continues to evolve and improve over time. \n\nThe Tesla Model S was the first electric vehicle to break the 400-mile range barrier, achieving an EPA range of up to 405 miles on a single charge with specific models. This milestone underscored Tesla's leading position in battery technology and energy efficiency in electric vehicles. \n\nDesigned with its battery pack integrated into the vehicle's floor, the Tesla Model S benefits from a very low center of gravity. This innovative placement enhances handling and safety, significantly reducing the risk of rollovers compared to conventional vehicles. \n\nIn 2013, the Tesla Model S was awarded Motor Trend's prestigious Car of the Year, marking the first time an electric vehicle received this honor. The award recognized the Model S for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, and contribution to pushing the automotive industry forward. \n\nRecharging a Tesla Model S can cost significantly less than refueling a gasoline-powered car. On average, fully charging a Model S at home may cost around $15, offering a cost-effective alternative\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
