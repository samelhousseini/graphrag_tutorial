Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Using cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar, the system can control steering, acceleration, and braking under certain conditions, enhancing driver safety and convenience.\n\nTesla's commitment to sustainability is evident in the Model S's vegan interior option, which uses synthetic materials instead of leather. This option caters to environmentally conscious consumers seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and animal product consumption.\n\nThe Model S has a unique glass roof that provides passengers with a panoramic view of the sky, enhancing the driving experience with an open, airy feel. This feature also includes UV and infrared protection to keep the cabin comfortable in various weather conditions.\n\nTesla's supercharger network allows Model S owners to charge their vehicles quickly while on long trips, providing up to 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes of charging. This extensive network ensures convenience and minimal downtime for Tesla drivers.\n\nThe Model S's performance version, the Plaid, can reach top speeds of up to 200 mph,\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA<|>ORGANIZATION, COMPANY<|>Tesla is an automotive company known for its electric vehicles and commitment to sustainability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODEL S<|>PRODUCT, VEHICLE<|>The Model S is a luxury electric sedan produced by Tesla, featuring advanced technology and sustainability options)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPILOT SYSTEM<|>TECHNOLOGY, SYSTEM<|>The Autopilot system is a semi-autonomous driving technology developed by Tesla, using cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to control steering, acceleration, and braking under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGAN INTERIOR OPTION<|>FEATURE, OPTION<|>The vegan interior option in the Model S uses synthetic materials instead of leather, catering to environmentally conscious consumers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLASS ROOF<|>FEATURE, COMPONENT<|>The glass roof in the Model S provides a panoramic view of the sky and includes UV and infrared protection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERCHARGER NETWORK<|>INFRASTRUCTURE, NETWORK<|>Tesla's supercharger network allows Model S owners to charge their vehicles quickly, providing up to 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLAID<|>PRODUCT, VEHICLE<|>The Plaid is the performance version of the Model S, capable of reaching top speeds of up to 200 mph)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA<|>MODEL S<|>Tesla manufactures the Model S, a luxury electric sedan<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>AUTOPILOT SYSTEM<|>The Model S is equipped with Tesla's Autopilot system for semi-autonomous driving<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>VEGAN INTERIOR OPTION<|>The Model S offers a vegan interior option using synthetic materials<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>GLASS ROOF<|>The Model S features a unique glass roof with UV and infrared protection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>SUPERCHARGER NETWORK<|>Model S owners can use Tesla's supercharger network for quick charging<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODEL S<|>PLAID<|>The Plaid is the high-performance version of the Model S<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: significant role in Tesla's establishment of the Destination Charging network, consisting of charging stations at hotels, restaurants, and shopping centers, encouraging longer trips and EV adoption. \n\nTesla's Model S was the first to feature the \"Bioweapon Defense Mode,\" which uses the HEPA filter to create positive pressure inside the cabin, protecting occupants from external air pollution and even biohazards. \n\nThe electric all-wheel-drive system of the Model S provides superior traction control in various weather conditions. Unlike traditional AWD systems, Tesla's version can instantaneously adjust power to each axle for optimal grip. \n\nThe Model S introduced the concept of a \"frunk\" or front trunk, offering additional storage space where a conventional car's engine would be. This space is made possible by the compact nature of the electric powertrain. \n\nWith a focus on reducing range anxiety, Tesla has equipped the Model S with an on-board trip planner that calculates routes with Supercharger stops, ensuring drivers can reach their destination with minimum charging interruptions. \n\nTesla's Model S has been used in various professional settings, including as police patrol cars and in taxi fleets, demonstrating its versatility, reliability, and low operating costs compared to conventional vehicles. \n\nThe aluminum body of the Model S contributes to its lightweight structure, enhancing both efficiency and performance. This use of aluminum also improves vehicle safety by absorbing impact energy more effectively than steel. \n\nThe Model S's underbody is completely flat, contributing to its aerodynamic efficiency. This design choice helps\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
