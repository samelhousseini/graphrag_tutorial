Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The award recognized the Model S for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, and contribution to pushing the automotive industry forward. \n\nRecharging a Tesla Model S can cost significantly less than refueling a gasoline-powered car. On average, fully charging a Model S at home may cost around $15, offering a cost-effective alternative to gasoline that can result in substantial savings over time. \n\nThe Tesla Model S maximizes its storage capacity by offering up to 28 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down, including a front trunk due to the absence of a traditional engine. This spaciousness is unusual for a sedan, providing ample room for luggage, shopping, and more.\n\nThe Tesla Model S has set a benchmark for electric vehicle safety, achieving a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>VEHICLE, PRODUCT<|>The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle known for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, cost-effective recharging, spacious storage capacity, and high safety ratings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTOR TREND<|>ORGANIZATION, PUBLICATION<|>Motor Trend is a publication that awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>AWARD, RECOGNITION<|>Car of the Year is a prestigious award given by Motor Trend to recognize exceptional vehicles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION, GOVERNMENT AGENCY<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is a government agency that awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>MOTOR TREND<|>Motor Trend awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>The Tesla Model S received the Car of the Year award from Motor Trend in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: modes.
