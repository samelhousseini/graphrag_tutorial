Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The award recognized the Model S for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, and contribution to pushing the automotive industry forward. \n\nRecharging a Tesla Model S can cost significantly less than refueling a gasoline-powered car. On average, fully charging a Model S at home may cost around $15, offering a cost-effective alternative to gasoline that can result in substantial savings over time. \n\nThe Tesla Model S maximizes its storage capacity by offering up to 28 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down, including a front trunk due to the absence of a traditional engine. This spaciousness is unusual for a sedan, providing ample room for luggage, shopping, and more.\n\nThe Tesla Model S has set a benchmark for electric vehicle safety, achieving a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>VEHICLE, PRODUCT<|>The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle known for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, cost-effective recharging, spacious storage capacity, and high safety ratings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTOR TREND<|>ORGANIZATION, PUBLICATION<|>Motor Trend is a publication that awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>AWARD, RECOGNITION<|>Car of the Year is a prestigious award given by Motor Trend to recognize exceptional vehicles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION, GOVERNMENT AGENCY<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is a government agency that awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>MOTOR TREND<|>Motor Trend awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>The Tesla Model S received the Car of the Year award from Motor Trend in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: of uses, from daily commuting to hauling larger items. \n\nThe Model S includes an advanced suspension system that can adjust the car's height in real-time based on driving conditions. This adaptive air suspension ensures a comfortable ride while optimizing aerodynamics and energy efficiency. \n\nTesla's continuous updates to the Model S include aesthetic refinements, such as updated interior finishes and exterior styling tweaks. These changes keep the vehicle looking modern and fresh, reflecting Tesla's commitment to design evolution alongside technological innovation.\n\nTesla's Model S was among the first to introduce a large digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel, displaying critical driving information and customizable widgets. This feature enhances the driving experience by providing clear, easily accessible data. \n\nThe Ludicrous mode available in certain Model S versions pushes the car's acceleration to extreme levels, enabling it to outperform many supercars in drag races. This mode showcases Tesla's engineering prowess in electric vehicle performance. \n\nTesla's Model S design includes a continuous, unbroken taillight strip that stretches across the rear, adding to its futuristic aesthetic. This distinctive design element makes the Model S instantly recognizable on the road. \n\nThe Model S's vegan interior option reflects Tesla's commitment to sustainability, offering a luxury experience without the use of animal products. This choice is part of Tesla's broader environmental and ethical considerations. \n\nIn 2016, Tesla introduced the Enhanced Autopilot feature, which added more advanced autonomous driving capabilities to the Model S, such as the ability to automatically change lanes on the\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
