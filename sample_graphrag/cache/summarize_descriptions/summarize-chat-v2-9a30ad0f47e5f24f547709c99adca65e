{"result": "The Tesla Model S features a regenerative braking system that extends the vehicle's range and reduces brake pad wear. This innovative system converts kinetic energy back into battery power, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and sustainability of the vehicle. By capturing and reusing energy that would otherwise be lost during braking, the regenerative braking system not only contributes to a longer driving range but also minimizes the frequency of brake pad replacements, offering both economic and environmental benefits.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Automotive Technology and Innovation.
