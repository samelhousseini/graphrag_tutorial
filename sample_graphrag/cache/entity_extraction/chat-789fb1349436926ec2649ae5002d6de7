Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The award recognized the Model S for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, and contribution to pushing the automotive industry forward. \n\nRecharging a Tesla Model S can cost significantly less than refueling a gasoline-powered car. On average, fully charging a Model S at home may cost around $15, offering a cost-effective alternative to gasoline that can result in substantial savings over time. \n\nThe Tesla Model S maximizes its storage capacity by offering up to 28 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down, including a front trunk due to the absence of a traditional engine. This spaciousness is unusual for a sedan, providing ample room for luggage, shopping, and more.\n\nThe Tesla Model S has set a benchmark for electric vehicle safety, achieving a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>VEHICLE, PRODUCT<|>The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle known for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, cost-effective recharging, spacious storage capacity, and high safety ratings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTOR TREND<|>ORGANIZATION, PUBLICATION<|>Motor Trend is a publication that awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>AWARD, RECOGNITION<|>Car of the Year is a prestigious award given by Motor Trend to recognize exceptional vehicles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION, GOVERNMENT AGENCY<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is a government agency that awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>MOTOR TREND<|>Motor Trend awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>The Tesla Model S received the Car of the Year award from Motor Trend in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: charging interruptions. \n\nTesla's Model S has been used in various professional settings, including as police patrol cars and in taxi fleets, demonstrating its versatility, reliability, and low operating costs compared to conventional vehicles. \n\nThe aluminum body of the Model S contributes to its lightweight structure, enhancing both efficiency and performance. This use of aluminum also improves vehicle safety by absorbing impact energy more effectively than steel. \n\nThe Model S's underbody is completely flat, contributing to its aerodynamic efficiency. This design choice helps to reduce air resistance and increase range, setting a standard for electric vehicle design. \n\nTesla's commitment to performance led to the development of the Track Mode for the Model S, optimizing the vehicle's settings for circuit driving. This mode adjusts the power distribution, regenerative braking, and cooling systems for optimal track performance. \n\nThe carbon fiber spoiler available on the Model S not only adds to its sporty aesthetic but also improves stability at high speeds by increasing downforce. This component reflects Tesla's attention to both form and function. \n\nThe panoramic sunroof option for the Model S incorporates UV and infrared protection, reducing heat and sun exposure while providing an open, airy feeling inside the cabin. \n\nTesla's focus on technology extends to the Model S's keyless entry and start system, which uses a smartphone app or a sleek card key for vehicle access. This system enhances convenience and security. \n\nThe adaptive lighting system in the Model S automatically adjusts the direction and range of the headlights based on driving speed and\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
