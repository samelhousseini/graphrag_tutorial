Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The award recognized the Model S for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, and contribution to pushing the automotive industry forward. \n\nRecharging a Tesla Model S can cost significantly less than refueling a gasoline-powered car. On average, fully charging a Model S at home may cost around $15, offering a cost-effective alternative to gasoline that can result in substantial savings over time. \n\nThe Tesla Model S maximizes its storage capacity by offering up to 28 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down, including a front trunk due to the absence of a traditional engine. This spaciousness is unusual for a sedan, providing ample room for luggage, shopping, and more.\n\nThe Tesla Model S has set a benchmark for electric vehicle safety, achieving a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>VEHICLE, PRODUCT<|>The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle known for its exceptional performance, innovative technology, cost-effective recharging, spacious storage capacity, and high safety ratings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTOR TREND<|>ORGANIZATION, PUBLICATION<|>Motor Trend is a publication that awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>AWARD, RECOGNITION<|>Car of the Year is a prestigious award given by Motor Trend to recognize exceptional vehicles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>ORGANIZATION, GOVERNMENT AGENCY<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is a government agency that awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>MOTOR TREND<|>Motor Trend awarded the Tesla Model S the Car of the Year in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>CAR OF THE YEAR<|>The Tesla Model S received the Car of the Year award from Motor Trend in 2013<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TESLA MODEL S<|>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<|>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the Tesla Model S a 5-star safety rating<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: 's \"Dog Mode\" feature allows owners to safely leave their pets in the car by maintaining a comfortable cabin temperature and displaying a message on the central screen indicating to passersby that the pet is safe.\n\nTesla's commitment to performance led to the development of the \"Ludicrous Mode\" for the Model S, enabling the car to achieve maximum acceleration. This mode showcases the instant torque characteristic of electric motors, delivering exhilarating performance.\n\nThe Model S has inspired a range of aftermarket customization options, from body kits to performance upgrades, demonstrating the car's popularity and the enthusiasm of its owner community. This aftermarket ecosystem allows owners to personalize their vehicles further.\n\nThe Tesla Model S has set new standards in electric vehicle safety, achieving a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in every category and subcategory. Its unique electric architecture and low center of gravity contribute to its high safety ratings. \n\nTesla introduced the Autopilot feature for the Model S, which provides advanced driver-assistance capabilities including lane keeping, traffic-aware cruise control, and self-parking. Over time, software updates have continuously enhanced these features, pushing towards full self-driving capabilities. \n\nThe exterior of the Tesla Model S includes door handles that are flush with the body of the car. These handles automatically extend when a driver approaches or with a simple touch, reducing aerodynamic drag and adding a sleek look to the vehicle's design. \n\nThe Model S was one of the first cars to use LED\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
